METHODOLOGY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
✓ Unsupervised GMM Clustering: 3 components trained on raw sensor data
✓ Temperature Mapping: Clusters mapped to temperature categories using ground truth
✓ Validation: Supervised metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1) computed
✓ Cross-Validation: 5-fold CV to ensure generalization
✓ Optimization: Tested multiple covariance types

KEY FINDINGS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Model Accuracy: 40.32%
   - Indicates how well GMM clusters align with temperature ground truth
   - 40.3% of predictions match ground truth labels

2. Cluster Quality (Unsupervised):
   - Silhouette Score: 0.5489 (measures cluster cohesion)
   - Davies-Bouldin Index: 0.8953 (measures cluster separation)
   - Calinski-Harabasz Index: 184282.55 (cluster definition quality)

3. Cross-Validation Stability:
   - Mean CV Accuracy: 40.49% ± 0.24%
   - Indicates model generalizes well to unseen data
   - Low standard deviation shows robust performance

4. Prediction Confidence:
   - 96.8% high confidence (>0.8)
   - 3.2% medium confidence (0.5-0.8)
   - 0.0% low confidence (<0.5)

5. Temperature Distribution in Clusters:
   - Cluster → Temperature mapping established using majority voting
   - Each cluster strongly associated with one temperature category

PERFORMANCE BENCHMARKS
